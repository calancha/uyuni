Feature: Bootstrap a Salt minion via the GUI using SSH key

  Scenario: Delete SLES minion system profile before bootstrap with SSH key test
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I follow "Delete System"
    Then I should see a "Confirm System Profile Deletion" text
    When I click on "Delete Profile"
    And I wait until I see "has been deleted" text

    Given I am authorized
    When I go to the bootstrapping page
    Then I should see a "Bootstrap Minions" text
    When I enter the hostname of "sle_minion" as "hostname"
    And I enter "22" as "port"
    And I enter "root" as "user"
    And I check radio button "SSH Private Key"
    And I attach the file "ssh_keypair/id_rsa_bootstrap-passphrase_linux" to "privKeyFile"

    Given I am authorized
    When I go to the minion onboarding page
    Then I should see a "accepted" text
    When I navigate to "rhn/systems/Overview.do" page
    And I wait until I see the name of "sle_minion", refreshing the page
    And I wait until onboarding is completed for "sle_minion"

    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    Then I should see a "Default" text
  
  Scenario: Cleanup: restore authorized keys
    When I restore the SSH authorized_keys file of host "sle_minion"

  Scenario: Cleanup: turn the SLES minion into a container build host after bootstrap with SSH key
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I follow "Details" in the content area
    And I follow "Properties" in the content area
    And I check "container_build_host"
    And I click on "Update Properties"

  Scenario: Cleanup: turn the SLES minion into a OS image build host after bootstrap with SSH key
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I follow "Details" in the content area

    And I check "osimage_build_host"
    And I click on "Update Properties"

    And I should see a "To apply the state, either use the states page or run state.highstate from the command line." text
    And I should see a "System properties changed" text

  Scenario: Cleanup: apply the highstate to build host after bootstrap with SSH key
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    When I wait until no Salt job is running on "sle_minion"
    And I enable repositories before installing Docker
    And I apply highstate on "sle_minion"
    And I wait until "docker" service is active on "sle_minion"

    And I disable repositories after installing Docker

  Scenario: Cleanup: check that the minion is now a build host after bootstrap with SSH key
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this "sle_minion"
    Then I should see a "[Container Build Host]" text
    And I should see a "[OS Image Build Host]" text
